Buyu Li is a PhD candidate at [Multimedia Lab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (MMLab), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). He also has a close research collaboration with [Yu Liu](http://liuyu.us/), Quanquan Li, [Junjie Yan](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/jjyan/main.htm) and Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/wanli.ouyang.php). 

He used to work as a computer vision researcher in [Sensetime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/) (2016-2017). During this period, he was a member of the CUImage team that won the first place in ILSVRC2016 DET (ImageNet).

His research interests now include but not limit to object detection (both 2D and 3D), and 3D animation.
